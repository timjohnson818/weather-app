# weather-app

## Description

    When a user enters the name of a city into the search bar and presses submit a five day forecast will appear in a table, their past searches are saved
    in local storage and can be clicked on to reload the forecast for that city.

    - As I am coming back to this project after sever months i hoped that it would serve as a great refresher for these basic front end skills.

    - I learned that if I do not use these skills regularly then they are vulnerable to atrophy as even though I am many months further into the bootcamp
    I Found myself having to relearn a lot of these basic skills that we took for granted later on in the class. 

    - Rereading our class materials, using online resources like w3schools, and even chatgpt (which I found is remarkebly good at explaining these concepts and it even taught me different ways of doing things that I never saw or heard of before.) makes me feel like my foundations have been strengthend.

## Usage


    -Simply type the name of a city that you would like to see the 5-day weather forecast for into the search bar and then click submit

    -If you would like to revisit a city that you loked at in the past, click on the name of the city in the "previous searches" table
